### Cube Solver

Rotate and position a set of 3D shapes to form a cube.
The solved cube will produce some data.

### Setup

I used mittsu for some visualizations: https://github.com/jellymann/mittsu

Mittsu depends on Ruby 2.x, OpenGL 3.3+, and GLFW 3.1.x

```
# OSX
$ brew install glfw3

# Ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install libglfw3
```
